# Concept Projects (using Godot)

A space for creation using the Godot 4 game engine:

Ideas, concepts, programming demos, playtesting and furthering programming/game design skills, and more!
I plan to use this space to create and implement simple function concepts that could be used to either integrate into a game mechanic,
or simple to help in future projects.


After 2 months of exploring the world of game design and learning how to to use the Godot engine, this will test smaller concepts in the form of mini-projects / demos for further game implementation usage.

### Ideas
- Further simple design skills
- Improve knowledge with coding/scripting and creating functions
- Implementing design mechanics into a game (using pseudocode)
- Improve knowledge of loops and how to provide randomness in games


### Concepts
- Procedural world generation / Procedural dungeon-style generation
- AI enemy programming
- Room / Level design
- Dynamic backgrounds
- Animation improvement 
- Use of Timers / pawning enemies


### Projects
| Project |              Description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| [Enemy Spawning](#enemy-spawning) | Designing a system that spawns enemies for implementation in levels |
| [AI Functionality](#ai-functionality) | Designing/testing functionality for AI/enemiey behavior |
| [Character Creation](#character-creation) | Designing a system for players to customize their character with multiple categories of choices |




### Enemy Spawning
 - This project implements a Timer based spawn system for enemies
 - Enemies are spawned at a random position based on a given range of coordinates
 - Allows for enemies to be created seperately from main scene and implemented as desired

 Ideas for Improvement: Change size of spawned enemies, randomize timer, try with different enemies types

 ### AI Functionality
 - This project implements different behaviors for enemies that could be used for future game development projects
 - Enemies are designed to have completely autonomous behavior and react in specific ways according to the play of the user
 - Allows for enemies to be more responsive, smarter, and give a more fulfilling experience for players

 Ideas for Improvement: Designing several more typs of AI funcitonality and enemy behaviors - conditional statements for even more uniqueness

 ### Character Creation
 - This project implements a system of character customization for a player
 - Assets are properly stored, loaded, and fit with each model when the player reels through options given
 - Allows for customization and player input when choosing their own design

 Ideas for Improvement: Upgraded assets for models, 3D models/assetts, full rotation of character during customization process
