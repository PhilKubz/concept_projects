# concept_projects

A space for creation using the Godot 4 game engine:

Ideas, concepts, programming demos, playtesting and furthering programming/game design skills, and more!
I plan to use this space to create and implement simple function concepts that could be used to either integrate into a game mechanic,
or simple to help in future projects.


-- After 2 months of exploring the world of game design and learning how to to use the Godot engine, this will test smaller concepts in the form of mini-projects / demos for further game implementation usage.
